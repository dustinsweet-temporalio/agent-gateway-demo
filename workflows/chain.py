        gates on staging" when a caller asks it to hurry.

            read the deployed production version
            compute the next version from the bump type
            cut that release                       (CutReleaseChildWorkflow)
            promote it to staging                  (PromoteReleaseChildWorkflow;
                                                    skipped for a staging target)
            wait for THAT candidate's gate verdict (skipped for a staging target)
            look for a security scan provider      (allow_scan only)
            -- caller either hands off to the scan, or creates the target
               promotion as the child operation --

        A staging target gets the first leg only: the staging promotion is then
        the child, and there is nothing to qualify a candidate for.

        Note what the gate step is and is not. The pipeline does not run the
        gates; reaching staging is what starts a gate run, whoever caused it,
        including a CASE-1 operator promoting by hand. What the pipeline does is
        wait for the verdict belonging to the candidate it just staged, and stop
        if it is not green. The policy is unchanged from when this ran the gates
        itself -- a candidate that fails never reaches the approval queue -- only
        the mechanism for obtaining the verdict is.

        allow_scan is set only on the first pass of a controlled, bump-driven
        run. A replay is finishing an approval that was already granted against a
        promotion that already exists, so there is nothing left to hand off; and
        an uncontrolled caller cannot be parked waiting on another system's
        verdict, since not being able to wait is what makes it uncontrolled.

        Every step is an ordinary Activity, so the work is in Event History and a
        Worker or gateway restart resumes rather than starting over. That matters
        far more now than when this only cut a release: the gate run is minutes of
        work sitting in the checkpoint while a human decides.

        Returns the aggregate result to checkpoint, plus the version it resolved.
        Raises InvalidVersionError if the deployed version or bump type cannot be
        interpreted, and QualityGateFailure if the gates do not pass. The caller
        turns both into a failed operation with no child, so a candidate that
        failed its gates never reaches the approval queue at all.

        Idempotency keys are split by what the step does, not by which pass it is.
        The mutations (the cut, the staging promotion) are keyed once, so a replay
        finds them already done and does not repeat them. The read and the quality
        gates are keyed per pass, so a replay re-reads production and re-verifies
        rather than trusting a verdict from before the pause. expect_version is set
        on a replay: if re-reading production yields a different next version than
        the one already approved, this raises PipelineVersionDrift before touching
        anything.

        Waiting for each step is just awaiting the Activity. There is no async
        handle to poll at this layer: the sync/async conversion is a gateway
        HTTP-boundary behavior (a client-side wait budget in gateway.server, see
        _TOOL_STRATEGY), not something a tool returns, and inside the Workflow the
        Activity await already is the durable wait for the real result.

        every step was the Waypoint team's own work, correctly modeled as ordinary
        Activities inside this workflow, because one team genuinely owns cutting
        and staging and gating a release. A pre-prod security scan is not that. It
        is another team's system, and what happens next is a real handoff to it.

        The handoff is a Nexus call, straight from workflow code, to an endpoint
        the Security team owns. Notice everything this workflow does not know: not
        their namespace, not their task queue, not their workflow type, not which
        stages a scan runs, and not what would make one fail. It knows an endpoint
        name and an operation contract, and they can change everything behind it
        without this file being edited.

        The operation is deliberately synchronous, returning as soon as the scan
        has started. An asynchronous operation awaited for the whole scan would
        read better right up until this workflow continued-as-new, which it does
        on Temporal's suggestion and will certainly do across an open-ended human
        approval. Nexus operation handles do not survive Continue-As-New; a
        workflow id does, because it is data. So the pipeline takes the id and
        parks on its own state, which is the same reason approval deadlines here
        are absolute timestamps rather than Timers.

        The pipeline operation is parked, not finished. Nothing else in this
        workflow is blocked meanwhile: the chain keeps taking tool calls and
        approvals for anything else the operator is doing.

        A scan that cannot be started stops the release. The alternative is
