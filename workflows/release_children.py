"""The Waypoint engineering team's own release steps, as Child Workflows.

Three workflows live here, all owned by the Waypoint team, all running in the
gateway's own `agent-gateway` namespace on the existing `agentic-gateway` task
queue, started from AgenticChainWorkflow. None of them is a new namespace, a new
worker, or a new task queue.

That is the whole point of the distinction they draw against
SecurityScanWorkflow. That one is a peer in another namespace because a
different Porticour engineering team genuinely owns it, and the boundary between
them is a Nexus Endpoint. These three are the Waypoint team's own tooling,
invoked by the Waypoint team's own gateway workflow, and a Child Workflow is the
right primitive for exactly the reasons the SA best-practices guide lists as
legitimate: each is a unit of work worth giving its own Event History, its own
independently retryable steps, and its own workflow id in the Web UI. Not "to
organize code" and not "to reduce cost", both of which would be bad reasons.

The naming convention carries the distinction. Anything ending in
`ChildWorkflow` is same-namespace, same-team, started as a child of the chain.
`SecurityScanWorkflow` deliberately has no such suffix, because it is not one.
