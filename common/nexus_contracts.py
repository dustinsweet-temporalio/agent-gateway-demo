"""Agent Gateway's view of the Nexus boundary with the Security team.

Two services cross this boundary, in opposite directions:

  AgentGatewayService    handled here, called by the Security team. How another
                         team's tool asks the gateway to perform a protected
                         action, and how it learns what a human decided.
  SecurityScanService    handled by the Security team, called from here. How the
                         release pipeline starts a pre-prod security scan.

What is deliberately absent from this file is as important as what is in it:
there is no namespace, no task queue, and no workflow type name belonging to the
other team. A Nexus Endpoint is the only thing either side addresses, and the
team that owns an endpoint can re-point it, rename their workflows, or move
namespaces without anyone on the other side editing code.

security_scan/nexus_contracts.py declares the mirror image of this file. The
two are duplicated on purpose -- they are the published interface between two
services, which is exactly the thing that is legitimate to state twice, unlike
an internal request struct copied field by field.
