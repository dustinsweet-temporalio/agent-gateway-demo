Separate namespace, separate task queue, separate container, separate identity in
the Temporal UI. None of that is decoration: the claim CASE-2b makes is that the
pre-prod security scan is another team's independently durable system, and a class
name in someone else's worker would not be that.

Run it with:  python -m security_scan.worker
