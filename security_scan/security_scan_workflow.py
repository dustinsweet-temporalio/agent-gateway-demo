class SecurityScanWorkflow:
    """The Security team's pre-prod scan, and the checkpoint that outlives a pause.

    This is Tool1 in the requirements document's sense: a tool that is owned and
    operated by another team, is independently durable, and can therefore be told
    "waiting_for_approval" and survive it. Nothing about that is simulated here.
    This workflow runs in the security namespace, on the security-tq task queue,
    in a worker process the Agent Gateway team does not deploy. It is not a child
    workflow of the chain: the two are peers, correlated by a shared workflow_id
    value that is passed in explicitly.

    A scan is the honest version of this claim. It is genuinely long-running and
    genuinely variable -- a dependency scan against a fresh advisory feed, an
    image scan over a rebuilt base layer, and every so often a flagged finding
    that stops the whole thing until a reviewer looks at it. Something that has to
    hold its place across that cannot be a request-scoped process, and the
    Security team's platform was durable long before Agent Gateway existed.

    The shape of the run is:

        run the scan stages, one at a time, entirely on its own
        if any stage finds something at or above the threshold, stop; the gateway
            is never asked
        otherwise, call Agent Gateway's Nexus endpoint to request the promotion
        SUSPEND on that operation until a human somewhere decides

    The stop is the whole point, and it is a real suspension of this workflow's
    own execution rather than of Agent Gateway's. Kill this worker while the
    operation is pending and the stage results, the verdict, and the pending
    operation all come back on replay, with the wait resuming exactly where it
    was.

    Note how little this workflow knows about the other side. It calls an
    endpoint by name. It does not know Agent Gateway's namespace, holds no
    credentials for it, names none of its workflows, and does not construct any
    of its internal types. There is no callback Signal to receive, because the
    Nexus operation's own completion is the answer.
