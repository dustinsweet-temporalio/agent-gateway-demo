# the workflow makes directly. There is no longer any code in this package that
# needs credentials for someone else's cluster.

# Scripted per-stage findings, indexed by stage number, expressed as the highest
# severity that stage turned up. Fixed sequences rather than a real scanner's
# output, so the same demo run produces the same result every time and "watch the
# secret detection stage" is a thing a presenter can actually say.
#
#   pass            every stage clears; one low finding, which is under the
#                   threshold and therefore not a blocker
#   fail            the dependency scan turns up a high straight away, so the
#                   scan dies at stage 1 and Agent Gateway is never called at all
#   flaky_then_pass the first stage is over threshold and the rest are clean. The

#                   out or rescanned past. Use it to show exactly that, not to
