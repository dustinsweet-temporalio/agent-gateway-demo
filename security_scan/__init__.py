"""The Security team's pre-prod scanning platform.

A separate system from the Waypoint team's release pipeline, and a separate
Porticour engineering team: its own Temporal namespace,
its own task queue, its own worker process, its own deploy cadence. It talks to
Agent Gateway over the wire and shares no internal Python code with it.

Nothing in this package may import from gateway/, workflows/, activities/, or
common/. If you find yourself wanting to, the thing you want is a wire type, and
it belongs in security_scan/models.py as this team's own copy of the contract.
