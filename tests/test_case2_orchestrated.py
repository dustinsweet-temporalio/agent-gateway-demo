"""CASE-2, orchestrated: Tool1 works out the version instead of being told it.

The explicit-version CASE-2 path is covered by
tests/test_temporal_scenarios.py::test_case2_controlled_resume_and_uncontrolled_fail_closed,
which is deliberately untouched. These tests cover the bump-driven path and use
their own Activity fakes so nothing here can alter the fixtures that suite (or
the CASE-1 and CASE-3 suites in it) depends on.

The invoke_tool fake here delegates to the real deployment backend in
mock_tool.server rather than returning a canned dict, so what the orchestrator
reads back is what the real tool would say: prod really is on 2.2.0, a minor bump
really lands on 2.3.0, and cutting the same version twice really is a no-op.

Cutting and promoting are Child Workflows, so the real steps inside them are
swapped for the fakes in tests/release_step_fakes.py. The children themselves,
the gate run a staging landing triggers, and the pipeline's version-keyed wait on
that gate are all real here; only the leaf Activities are stubbed, to drop the
HTTP calls and the demo-paced sleeps.
