"""The company-wide security mandate toggle, and the two things it changes.

The mandate is the in-story policy that lands between the two acts of the CASE-2
walkthrough: no engineering team promotes its own service to production on its own
say-so any more. Mechanically it is a single runtime flag on the gateway process,
and it does two things:

  * a production promotion created while it is on carries
    required_approver_team="security", so Security approves every production
    release whoever asked for it
  * the release pipeline routes a qualified candidate through the Security team's
    pre-prod scan; with the mandate off there is no scan step in the flow at all

This file owns the first. The second is asserted where the scan fixture lives, in
test_case2b_security_scan.py.

The mandate changes nothing about how the approver restriction is enforced. There
is exactly one authorization mechanism -- Operation.required_approver_team,
checked by gateway.server._authorize_approver at the HTTP boundary and again by
AgenticChainWorkflow._approver_authorized on the durable side -- and these tests
assert against that same mechanism rather than a second one.

Five claims:

  default off        a fresh gateway process restricts nothing, so CASE-1 as it
                     was demoed is unchanged
  scope              on, a production promotion is Security's whoever asked; a
                     staging one is nobody's in particular
  grandfathering     the value is snapshotted onto the request, so flipping the
                     toggle does not reach back into operations already queued
  dashboard          the switch says what it did, and the fleet panel draws a
                     scan step in the pipeline the moment it is flipped, because
                     that is the moment there is one
  end to end         the Act One shape: mandate on, uncontrolled caller gone,
                     Waypoint refused, Security approves, promotion lands
