"""CASE-2b: the pre-prod security scan as a genuinely separate, durable Tool1.

Everything here runs against two Temporal namespaces and two Worker processes,
because that is the claim under test. A single-namespace version of this suite
would pass while proving nothing: the point is not that a scan workflow exists,
it is that it exists somewhere Agent Gateway does not own, suspends its own
execution across an approval it does not control, and is woken by a Signal that
crosses the boundary.

What each test pins down:

  the handoff       the pipeline parks itself and starts a workflow in the other
                    namespace, rather than opening the production promotion
  the nested call   the scan calls back into the SAME chain workflow_id, so one
                    user-visible task spans two systems
  the suspension    the scan stops at waiting_for_approval and its state survives
                    a worker being torn down and replaced underneath it
  the wake          approval in the gateway signals the scan back across the
                    namespace boundary, and both sides end up consistent
  fail closed       a scan that fails never calls the gateway at all, so the
                    promotion is never put in front of a human
  before 2b         with no scan provider registered, the pipeline behaves
                    exactly as CASE-2a did
  mandate off       with the mandate off there is no scan step in the flow at
                    all, even with a provider up and advertising
