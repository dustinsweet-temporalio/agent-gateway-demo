"""The demo-ability addendum's own behaviors, tested directly.

Four claims that the CASE-1/2a/2b suites exercise only incidentally:

  depth              cut_release and promote_release are Child Workflows whose
                     individual steps are visible in Event History by name
  ambient gates      a CASE-1 manual staging promotion, with no pipeline
                     anywhere, moves the gate card idle -> running -> passed
  fail before live   a promotion whose instances fail their health check never
                     routes traffic
  team authorization an operation with no required team is decided by anyone,
                     and one that requires a team is decided only by that team
