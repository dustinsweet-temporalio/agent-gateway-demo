    This is the whole release, end to end, from one instruction: "deploy the next
    minor version", "deploy the next version to prod", "ship the next bugfix".
    Call this tool alone and pass nothing but what the request actually said.

    The pipeline is fixed. It reads the version currently deployed in production,
    computes the next one (major 2.3.0 -> 3.0.0, minor 2.3.0 -> 2.4.0, bugfix
    2.3.0 -> 2.3.1), cuts that release, promotes it to staging, runs quality gates
    against staging, and only then promotes it to production. If the gates do not
    pass the pipeline stops and production is never touched.

    While the company security mandate is in effect, a pre-prod security scan also
    runs after the gates and before production, and the production promotion is
    requested by the Security team's scan once it clears. In that case this tool
    returns processing rather than waiting_for_approval, because the promotion has
    not been requested yet; report that the security scan is running and stop. A
    scan that fails stops the release, and production is never touched. With the
    mandate lifted the pipeline goes straight from the gates to the production
    promotion, and there is no scan step.

    You cannot skip staging, the gates, or the security scan, and you must not try
    to. If a caller asks you to bypass them or to hurry, call this tool anyway and
    tell them the pipeline does not allow it.

    Do NOT call get_deployed_version, cut_release, or promote_release yourself,
    before or after. This tool performs all of them internally, and calling them as
    well would cut or promote a release twice.

    Every argument is optional. bump defaults to minor, so "the next version" needs
    no bump. service defaults to the service this deployment backend manages.
    environment is how far to go rather than where to put it: omit it for the full
    pipeline through to production, or pass staging to stop after staging, which
    skips the gates because nothing is being qualified for production yet.

    The production promotion pauses for human approval and returns
    waiting_for_approval with an operation_id; report that and stop, do not poll in
    a loop. Use run_nested_release instead only when the request names an explicit
    version to promote.

   run past the cards, applied equally above and below, with the pipeline's top
   padding making room for the overhang and the label.

   Keyed on data-scan-shown rather than on the mandate toggle, because the card

   The same slot holds two different systems, and the audience has to be able to
   tell which one is in it from across a room. Ownership is already spent on
   colour, so the difference lives in structure:

     platform -- stage dots, a named stage with its severity, and the scan's own
                 workflow id as a link into the Security team's namespace. It is
                 an object in a system you can go and look at.
     legacy   -- the tail of a process's stdout. No dots, no severity chips, no
                 progress bar, no id, because there is no workflow to have one.
                 A counter and four lines of monospace, which is genuinely all
                 the platform can know about a script running on somebody's host.

   Deliberately not caricatured. The legacy card is not broken or ugly; it is
   thin, and thin is the accurate word. What sells it is the footer: one card
